                NASA’s future will continue to be a story of human exploration, technology, and science. We will go back to the Moon to learn more about what it will take to support human exploration to Mars and beyond. We will continue to nurture the development of a vibrant low-Earth orbit economy that builds on the work done to date by the International Space Station. NASA engineers will develop new technologies to improve air transport at home and meet the challenges of advanced space exploration. Our scientists will work to increase an understanding of our planet and our place in the universe. We will continue to try to answer the question, “Are we alone?”</p>
<br>
<p>Unlike the way the space program started, NASA will not be racing a competitor. Rather, we will build upon the community of industrial, international, and academic partnerships forged for the space station. Commercial companies will play an increasing role in the space industry: launching rockets and satellites, transporting cargo and crew, building infrastructure in low-Earth orbit. NASA will continue to be a global leader in scientific discovery, fostering opportunities to turn new knowledge into things that improve life here on Earth.

            Artist’s concept, NASA’s gateway in lunar orbit. It will consist of at least a power and propulsion element as well as habitation, logistics, and airlock capabilities. The power and propulsion element will be the first component to launch for placement near the Moon in 2022, with additional elements launching in subsequent years.

                In the half-century since people visited the Moon, NASA has continued to push the boundaries of knowledge to deliver on the promise of American ingenuity and leadership in space. And NASA will continue that work by moving forward to the Moon with astronauts landing on the lunar South Pole by 2024.</p>
                <br>
                <p>NASA is implementing the President’s Space Policy Directive-1 to “lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system.” NASA stands on the verge of commercializing low-Earth orbit. These experiences and partnerships will enable NASA to go back to the Moon in 2024 – this time to stay. NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration is the biggest rocket ever built, the Space Launch System (SLS), the Orion spacecraft and the Gateway lunar command module. With its partners, NASA will use the Gateway lunar command module orbiting the Moon as a staging point for missions that allow astronauts to explore more parts of the lunar surface than ever before</p>

                    NASA’s work in aeronautics has made decades of contributions to aviation, national security and our economy. Ongoing research and testing of new aeronautics technologies are critical in these areas and will help the U.S. lead the world in a global aviation economy, with increasing benefits worldwide. Developing quiet supersonic transport over land, and quieter, cleaner aircraft technologies are two ways NASA is transforming aviation.

    Artist’s concept of NASA’s X-57 ‘Maxwell’ aircraft. The X-57 will be the first all-electric X-plane and will be flown to demonstrate the benefits that electric propulsion may yield for the future of aviation. The goal of the X-57 is to achieve a 500-percent increase in high-speed cruise efficiency, zero in-flight carbon emissions, and flight that is much quieter for the community on the ground.

        <h2>Future of space exploration</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The <b>future of space exploration</b> involves both telescopic exploration and the physical exploration of space by <a href="/wiki/Robotic_spacecraft" title="Robotic spacecraft">robotic spacecraft</a> and <a href="/wiki/Human_spaceflight" title="Human spaceflight">human spaceflight</a>.
            
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
        Near-term physical exploration missions, focused on obtaining new information about the solar system, are planned and announced by both national and private organisations. There are tentative plans for crewed orbital and landing missions to the Moon and Mars to establish scientific outposts that will later enable permanent and self-sufficient settlements. Further exploration will potentially involve expedition and the other planets and settlements on the moon as well as establishing mining and fueling outposts, particularly in the asteroid belt. Physical exploration outside the solar System will be robotic for the foreseeable future.

        <p><a href="/learn/astro/solsys/planets/mars">Mars</a>&nbsp;is the closest planet to Earth. Many scientists see it as the next place for humans to explore. It could also be a stepping stone for exploration to more distant planets. NASA intends to send the first humans to Mars by 2030. SpaceX also want to send crewed missions to Mars. Their goal is to set up a human colony on the red planet.&nbsp;</p>    </div>

            <h1>Technology</h1>
            <p><a href="/learn/eng/exp/falcons">Reusable rockets</a> lower the cost of space flight. This opens up space travel for tourists, though it is still very expensive! Far in the future, robots will replace humans on space flights. Robots can carry out tasks, and cope with more extreme conditions than humans. Space exploration will be automated, so rockets will fly themselves without pilots!</p>
