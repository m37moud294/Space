            <p>Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure. 
                In space, sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to transmit
                 sound between them. Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around "emptier" 
                 areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies.</p>
            <p>From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is most often thought to begin about 62 miles (100 kilometers)
                above sea level at what is known as the Kármán line. This is an imaginary boundary at an altitude where there is
                 no appreciable air to breathe or scatter light. Passing this altitude, blue starts to give way to black because
                oxygen molecules are not in enough abundance to make the sky blue.</p> <br>

            <p>The majority of space is relatively empty, with just 
                stray bits of dust and gas floating around. This means that
                 when humans send a probe to a distant planet or asteroid, the craft
                  will not encounter "drag" in the same way that an airplane does as it
                   sails through space.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, the vacuum environment in space and on the moon, is one reason 
                why the lunar lander of the Apollo program was designed to have an almost
                 spider-like appearance, as it was described by the Apollo 9 crew. Because the
                  spacecraft was designed to work in a zone with no atmosphere, it didn't need to 
                  have smooth edges or an aerodynamic shape.</p>
            <p>In addition to the bits of debris that speckle the "emptier" regions of space,
                 research has shown that these areas are also home to different forms of radiation.
                  In our own solar system, the solar wind — charged particles that stream from the 
                  sun — emanate throughout the solar system and occasionally cause auroras near Earth's poles. 
                  Cosmic rays also fly through our neighborhood, stemming from supernovas outside of the solar system</p>
            <p>In fact, the universe as a whole is inundated with what is known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), 
                which is essentially the leftover radiation from the explosion mostly commonly known as the Big Bang. 
                The CMB is the oldest radiation that our instruments can detect.</p>

            <p>Stars (like our own sun) are immense balls of gas that produce their own radiation. They can range from red
                 supergiants to cooling white dwarfs that are the leftovers of supernovas, or star explosions that occur when
                  a big one runs out of gas to burn. These explosions spread elements throughout the universe and are the reason 
                  that elements such as iron exist. Star explosions can also give rise to incredibly dense objects called neutron 
                  stars. If these neutron stars send out pulses of radiation, they are called pulsar stars.</p>
            <p>Planets are objects whose definition came under scrutiny in 2006, when astronomers were debating whether Pluto could 
                be considered a planet or not. At the time, the International Astronomical Union (the governing body on Earth for these
                decisions) ruled that a planet is a celestial body that orbits the sun, is massive enough to have a nearly round shape,
                and has cleared its orbit of debris. Under this designation, Pluto and similar small objects are considered "dwarf planets,
                " although not everyone agrees with the designation. After the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, principal investigator
                Alan Stern and others again opened up the debate, saying the diversity of terrain on Pluto makes it more like a planet.</p>

            <p>Among the biggest cosmic structures we can see are galaxies, which essentially are vast collections of stars. Our own galaxy is called the
                 Milky Way, and is considered a "barred spiral" shape. There are several types of galaxies, ranging from spiral to elliptical to irregular,
                  and they can change as they come close to other objects or as stars within them age</p>
            <p>Often galaxies have supermassive black holes embedded in the center of their galaxies, which are only visible through the radiation that each
                 black hole emanates as well as through its gravitational interactions with other objects. If the black hole is particularly active, with a lot
                  of material falling into it, it produces immense amounts of radiation. This kind of a galactic object is called a quasar 
                  (just one of several types of similar objects.)</p>
            <p>Large groups of galaxies can form in clusters that are groups as large as hundreds or thousands of galaxies bound together gravitationally.
                 Scientists consider these the largest structures in the universe.

        <div class="p5">
            <p>Smaller black holes can form from the gravitational collapse of a gigantic star, which forms a singularity from which nothing can escape — not even
                 light, hence the name of the object. No one is quite sure what lies within a black hole, or what would happen to a person or object who fell into
                  it – but research is ongoing.</p>
            <p>An example is gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time that come from interactions between black holes. This was first predicted by Albert Einstein 
                at the turn of the last century, when he showed that time and space are linked; time speeds up or slows down when space is distorted.</p>
            <p>As of mid-2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration has announced three black-hole interactions 
                and mergers detected through gravitational waves, in just two years.</p>
            <p>The team found these three events in about two years, indicating that when LIGO is implemented at full sensitivity, the observatory may be able to 
                find these sorts of events frequently, scientists said in May 2017. Should a bunch of these black hole events be detected, it could help scientists
                 learn how black holes of a certain size (several tens of sun masses) are born, and later merge into new black holes.</p>
